Programming 3 ASP.NET using C#/MVC
By Ryan Sass

My term 3 project from Programming 3. A ASP.NET website using MVC pattern. 

This project extended the length of the entire programming 3 course. It took a lot of mental perserverence to push through and understand the MVC architecture, but as I continued to work hard and learn the material, the easier it came to me. I am super proud of this project and the strides I took from start to finish.
